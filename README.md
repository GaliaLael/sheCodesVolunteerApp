#### *Note*: I am well aware that C++ is not the best language choice for these sort of apps, but it perfectly suits my personal needs in this project: flexing my OOP muscles and learning to work with SQL, Qt and C++17.

## About this app:
she codes; is an organization operated by volunteers. As such, its systems are built on top of one another in many bits and pieces that don't communicate, since updating, maintaining and combining them is not top priority. As a branch manager in the organization, I need to update tables by hand with data taken from other tables that are updated automatically (or by another volunteer), where technically this could have all been automatic. This makes life unnecessarily complicated and leaves less time for the important work!
I took apon myself to create the one app to rule them all :elf_woman:. To combine all the operations done by the organization into one database.
